## Overview

Imagine that you’re a data analyst who’s been hired by a small medical practice to analyze the efficiency of four different doctors. The data set in question shows the morning schedules of these four doctors — Jessica, Fatima, Haruto, and Benjamin — over the course of a single week, as well as the duration of
their appointments with each patient. In this lab, your job is to analyze each doctor’s average time per patient, decide which doctor is the most efficient in terms of time, and create a visual aid to show these averages.
