## Data Set

There is no data set to download for this lab.

## Overview

Imagine you’re a financial analyst and you’re looking at banking data for one of your clients, Carla.
Your bank has created charts showing Carla’s monthly expenditures for three months in the autumn.
In this lab, you’ll flex your data fluency muscles by identifying whether a series of statements (or “data stories”) match the data visualizations/charts.

### Exercise 1: True or False

Here are three bar graphs showing Carla’s monthly spending for three months, broken down by category.
For the purposes of this lab, let’s say **the current month is November, and the month is less than halfway over**.

In this exercise, we’ll look at 10 different statements and determine whether each is true or false. Try to answer each question on your own before looking at the step-by-step explanations.
Decide whether each statement is true , false , or if we don’t have enough information.

1. Carla’s spending on entertainment increased between September and October.
2. In October, Carla spent less on gas than she did on groceries.
3. Carla’s three highest September expenditures were rent, student loans, and gas.
4. In September, Carla spent about 50% less on gas than she did in October.
5. None of Carla’s expenses stayed constant over all three months.
6. Carla’s student loans were always less expensive than her rent.
7. In the entire month of November, Carla spent much less on gas than she did in October.
8. In September, Carla spent twice as much on gas as she did on entertainment.
9. All of Carla’s expenses either increased or stayed the same between September and October.
10. November will be a less expensive month overall for Carla than October.
