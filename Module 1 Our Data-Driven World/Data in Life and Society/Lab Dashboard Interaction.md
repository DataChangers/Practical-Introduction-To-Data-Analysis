For our first lab, we’ll look at a powerful example of data analysis in action. (There are no instructions or data sets to download for this lab.)

Head over to this link: [Attendance Tracker](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Attendance-Tracker-Improving-School-Attendance-by-Decisive-Data/m-p/136078).

At the link, scroll down to the text beneath the dashboard/graphics and read the Background, Data Story, and Flow sections. Then follow the directions in the Interactions section of the text.

The dashboard is a great example of how effective data analysis can be in the real world. Take a while to really click through and interact with the dashboard itself, noting any features you find especially interesting. In the forum for this course, post any “ah-ha!” moments you had while interacting with the dashboard, and chat with your fellow students about it. (You can access the forum by clicking the “Discussion” tab at the top of the page.)

Once you’ve finished interacting with the dashboard, click on the “Lab Check” unit in this lesson and answer the question there.
