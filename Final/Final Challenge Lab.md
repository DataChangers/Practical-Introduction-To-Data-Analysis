# A Practical Introduction to Data Analysis for Absolute Beginners

## Final Challenge Lab

## Overview

In the mighty Kingdom of Atlantis, you’re a data analyst who’s been hired by the Queen to look at trends
in housing sales among different cities. Using this data, you’ll answer a series of questions comparing
various variables in the realm’s housing market.
In this challenge lab, you won’t be provided with the same step-by-step instructions as the previous labs
(that’s where the “challenge” part comes in). Good luck!

## Data Set

[Final Challenge data](Final%20Challenge%20data.xlsx)

You can download this data set and store it so you can use it later on for the lab questions.

## What You’ll Need

To complete the lab, you will need the online version of Microsoft Excel.

### Exercise 1: Housing Challenge

Open the data set in Excel, which lists 46 different cities in the Kingdom of Atlantis. The columns/variables represent the following:

* city = the name of the city
* sales = the number of home sales for that city
* volume = the total value of sales for that city, in Atlantean dollars
* median = the median home price for that city, in Atlantean dollars
* listings = the total number of active listings in that city
* inventory = the estimated amount of time to sell off the current inventory in that city, in weeks

With the data set open, answer the following questions. Enter your answers in the “Lab Check” quiz section following this lab. These questions are graded, so take your time and answer them carefully. Feel free to perform calculations with the data in Excel however you wish to come up with your answers.

1. Which city has the most sales?
2. What is the mean/average number of listings across all cities?
3. What is the correlation coefficient between number of sales and inventory?
4. What is the relationship between number of sales and median home price?
5. What is the relationship between listings and inventory?

Head to the “Lab Check” section of this lesson to enter your answers.
